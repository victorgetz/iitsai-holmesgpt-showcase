# Demo Project

This project serves as a demonstration of how HolmesGPT works in collaboration with a private Language Model (LLM) such as iits.ai

## About HolmesGPT and iits.ai

HolmesGPT is a state-of-art language model developed by OpenAI and is capable of composing human-like text.

iits.ai, on the other hand, is a private LLM solution with RAG 

## The Demo

In this demo, we have set up a system where HolmesGPT communicates with iits.ai to generate a self healing infrastructure system.

Our primary goal is to demonstrate the strengths of both HolmesGPT and iits.ai and how effective they can be when used together.

## Note

This is a demonstration project. The outputs produced are not for real-world application but merely to showcase the potentials of both the models.
